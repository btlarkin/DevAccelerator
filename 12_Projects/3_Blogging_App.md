# ✍️ Blogging App (Simple Full-Stack)

Transition to full-stack by building a dynamic blog with a backend API, following the build order of backend first, then frontend.

### Build Order:
1.  **[[personal-blog|Personal Blog]]:** Develop the frontend interface for the blog that consumes your API. (Frontend, Intermediate)
2.  **[[3_Blogging_App|Blogging Platform API]]:** Build the backend to handle posts, comments, and users. (Backend, Beginner)
3.  **[[basic-dockerfile|Basic Dockerfile]]:** Containerize your backend API for consistent deployment. (DevOps, Beginner)
4.  **[[ec2-instance|EC2 Instance]]:** Provision a cloud VM as your deployment target. (DevOps, Beginner)
5.  **[[nodejs-service-deployment|Node.js Service Deployment]]:** Create a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment to the cloud VM. (DevOps, Intermediate)

### Synergy & Future Features

- **Synergy:** This project is your first full-stack application, bridging frontend and backend development. The CI/CD pipeline you build here is a foundational step towards the more complex automation in the Notetaking App and E-Commerce clusters.
- **Future Features:** Add user authentication, a content management system (CMS), or implement a full-text search feature using Elasticsearch from your Unified IT Environment capstone.
