# ðŸ“š Phase 0: Primer

**Outcome:** Establish a foundational understanding of computer science concepts and build mathematical maturity.

### 1. Introduction to Computer Science

* [ ] **Harvard CS50** (CS50 is a great starting point to introduce you to computation and problem-solving).

### 2. Foundational Math

* [ ] **Calculus 1A: Differentiation** from OSSU "Core math".
* [ ] **Calculus 1B: Integration** from OSSU "Core math".
* [ ] **Calculus 1C: Coordinate Systems & Infinite Series** from OSSU "Core math".

**Note:** The Calculus courses can be done in parallel with other courses to build mathematical maturity.
