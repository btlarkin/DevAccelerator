# ðŸ“š Phase 0: Primer

**Outcome:** Establish a foundational understanding of computer science concepts and build mathematical maturity. Your terminal-first development environment is fully configured and ready for action.

### 1. Introduction to Computer Science

* [ ] **[Harvard CS50](https://youtu.be/h6lqxDwUmJQ?si=uzLE-N6VoMC6eDgL)** (CS50 is a great starting point to introduce you to computation and problem-solving).
* [ ] **Read *The Imposter's Handbook* series:** Read this in parallel to reinforce CS fundamentals. [[The Imposter_s Handbook.pdf|book 1]] [[The Imposter_s Handbook Season 2.pdf|book 2]]

### 2. Foundational Math

* [ ] **[Calculus 1A: Differentiation](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.01.1x+2T2019/about)** from OSSU "Core math".
* [ ] **[Calculus 1B: Integration](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.01.2x+3T2019/about)** from OSSU "Core math".
* [ ] **[Calculus 1C: Coordinate Systems & Infinite Series](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.01.3x+1T2020/about)** from OSSU "Core math".
**Note:** The Calculus courses can be done in parallel with other courses to build mathematical maturity.

### 3. Unified IT Environment Project: Local Development Environment Setup 

* [x] **Local Development Environment Setup:** This module is already complete, leveraging your mouseless, terminal-first setup. You have deployed your **Local Development VM** using VirtualBox with **Arch Linux** as your primary workstation. **Neovim, tmux, tmuxp, and your preferred command-line tools (fzf, ripgrep, etc.)** are fully configured and fluently used. Git is integrated for version control.
