### 4. Unified IT Environment Project: Phase 3 Modules

* **Module 3.1: Core DevOps Dashboard & CI/CD Pipeline**
    * [ ] Deploy a Testing, Ticketing, Deployment VM (Ubuntu Server) using Foreman.
    * [ ] Implement a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Runner** on this VM.
    * [ ] Configure automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end testing frameworks like Pytest, Jest, Selenium) and automated deployment processes within the pipeline.
    * [ ] Integrate with a ticketing system (e.g., Jira, Trello).
    * [ ] **Tool Focus:** Jenkins/GitLab CI/GitHub Actions, testing frameworks, ticketing system.
* **Module 3.2: Kubernetes Cluster Foundation**
    * [ ] Provision three VMs (1 master, 2 workers) for the Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm` (managed by Ansible/Foreman).
    * [ ] Integrate **MetalLB for load balancing, Nginx-ingress for external access, and Metrics-server for resource monitoring** within Kubernetes.
    * [ ] **Tool Focus:** Kubernetes (`kubeadm`, `kubectl`), Ansible, MetalLB, Nginx-ingress, Metrics-server.
* **Module 3.3: Internal Git Server & Registry**
    * [ ] Provision a VM (using Foreman) for hosting the internal Git server (**GitLab Community Edition or Gitea**).
    * [ ] Configure access controls, repositories, and webhooks on the Git server.
    * [ ] Provision another VM (using Foreman) to act as an **internal Docker registry** (e.g., `registry:2` or a private Harbor instance).
    * [ ] Configure Kubernetes nodes to use the internal registry for pulling container images, optimizing image pull times and security.
    * [ ] **Tool Focus:** GitLab CE/Gitea, Docker Registry, Kubernetes (image pulling configuration).
* **Module 3.4: Logging and Monitoring Core (ELK Stack)**
    * [ ] Provision three VMs (using Foreman) to host an **Elasticsearch cluster**.
    * [ ] Provision a VM for **Logstash** to collect and process logs.
    * [ ] Provision a VM for **Kibana** for data visualization.
    * [ ] Configure **Metricbeat, Filebeat, and Journalbeat** on *every host* to push comprehensive system metrics, log files, and journal logs to the Elasticsearch cluster.
    * [ ] **Tool Focus:** Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, various Beats, Ansible (for deployment).

**Deliverable:** A fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a Dockerized web application from the roadmap.sh project chain, demonstrating end-to-end CI/CD best practices and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) from a Git repository to a containerized deployment on a cloud VM. The core DevOps dashboard, Kubernetes cluster, internal Git/Registry, and ELK stack are all foundational components of your Unified IT Environment.
