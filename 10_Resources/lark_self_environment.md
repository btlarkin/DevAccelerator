[^1]: ### 1. **Create a Backup Script:**

    Create a script named `backup_freeipa.sh`:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Set the backup directory
    BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup/directory" # IMPORTANT: Adjust this path

    # Create a timestamp for the backup file
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

    # Perform the FreeIPA backup
    ipa-backup --data "${BACKUP_DIR}/backup_${TIMESTAMP}"
    ```

    Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x backup_freeipa.sh
    ```

### 2. **Test the Backup Script:**

    Manually run the script to ensure it performs the backup correctly:

    ```bash
    ./backup_freeipa.sh
    ```

    Verify that the backup files are created in the specified directory.

### 3. **Create a Systemd Timer Unit:**

    Create a file named `freeipa_backup.timer`:

    ```ini
    # /etc/systemd/system/freeipa_backup.timer

    [Unit]
    Description=Schedule FreeIPA Backup

    [Timer]
    OnCalendar=daily
    Persistent=true

    [Install]
    WantedBy=timers.target
    ```

    This timer is configured to run the backup script daily. Adjust the `OnCalendar` option as needed.

### 4. **Create a Systemd Service Unit:**

    Create a file named `freeipa_backup.service`:

    ```ini
    # /etc/systemd/system/freeipa_backup.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Execute FreeIPA Backup

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/path/to/backup_freeipa.sh # IMPORTANT: Adjust this path
    ```

### 5. **Reload Systemd and Enable the Timer:**

    Reload systemd to recognize the new units:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

    Enable the timer to start on boot:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable freeipa_backup.timer
    ```

    Start the timer:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start freeipa_backup.timer
    ```

### 6. **Monitor Timer Status:**

    Check the status of the timer to ensure it's running:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status freeipa_backup.timer
    ```

### **Notes:**

-   Adjust paths and file names as needed.
-   Ensure that the user running the systemd service has the necessary permissions to execute `ipa-backup`.
-   Monitor the logs for any issues: `journalctl -u freeipa_backup.service`

Now, your FreeIPA environment will be automatically backed up daily using systemd-timers.
