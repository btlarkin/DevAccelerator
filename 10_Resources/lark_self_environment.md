### Bonus Tasks
Implement a backup job/script[^1] for the FreeIPA environment using systemd-timers1.

Now, your IT environment is a comprehensive, integrated setup that covers various cloud platforms, development tools, and infrastructure components.

Footnotes
See here for the backup script implementation. 



[^1]: ### 1. **Create a Backup Script:**

Create a script named `backup_freeipa.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the backup directory
BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup/directory"

# Create a timestamp for the backup file
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

# Perform the FreeIPA backup
ipa-backup --data "${BACKUP_DIR}/backup_${TIMESTAMP}"
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x backup_freeipa.sh
```

### 2. **Test the Backup Script:**

Manually run the script to ensure it performs the backup correctly:

```bash
./backup_freeipa.sh
```

Verify that the backup files are created in the specified directory.

### 3. **Create a Systemd Timer Unit:**

Create a file named `freeipa_backup.timer`:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/freeipa_backup.timer

[Unit]
Description=Schedule FreeIPA Backup

[Timer]
OnCalendar=daily
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

This timer is configured to run the backup script daily. Adjust the `OnCalendar` option as needed.

### 4. **Create a Systemd Service Unit:**

Create a file named `freeipa_backup.service`:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/freeipa_backup.service

[Unit]
Description=Execute FreeIPA Backup

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/path/to/backup_freeipa.sh
```

### 5. **Reload Systemd and Enable the Timer:**

Reload systemd to recognize the new units:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Enable the timer to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable freeipa_backup.timer
```

Start the timer:

```bash
sudo systemctl start freeipa_backup.timer
```

### 6. **Monitor Timer Status:**

Check the status of the timer to ensure it's running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status freeipa_backup.timer
```

### **Notes:**

- Adjust paths and file names as needed.
- Ensure that the user running the systemd service has the necessary permissions to execute `ipa-backup`.
- Monitor the logs for any issues: `journalctl -u freeipa_backup.service`

Now, your FreeIPA environment will be automatically backed up daily using systemd-timers.
