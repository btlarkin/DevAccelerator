### What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the main way information is sent and received on the internet. It's like the language web browsers and servers use to talk to each other. When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server sends back the website data. Each request is separate, so the server doesn't remember past requests. HTTP has different commands (like GET for getting data, POST for sending it). HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts information. Newer versions like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are faster. Knowing HTTP is important for anyone building websites.

### Domain Name

A domain name is a human-friendly web address (e.g., google.com) that acts as a memorable substitute for numerical IP addresses. It comprises a second-level domain (like "google") and a top-level domain (like ".com"). Registered via domain registrars, these unique names are key for branding and online presence. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates these names into IP addresses, enabling easy website access. Domain names are vital for web structure and accessibility.

### Hosting

Web hosting is like renting space on the internet for your website. It means storing your website's files on special computers called servers, so people can visit your site. When someone types your website address, the hosting service sends them your site's content. There are different kinds of hosting, like shared hosting (sharing a server with others) or dedicated hosting (having a server all to yourself). Hosting companies often offer other services too, like email, domain names, and security certificates. Choosing the right hosting is important for how well your website works.

- [ ] [@video@Where to Host a Fullstack Project on a Budget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx_1NYYJS7Q)￼

### DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses computers use. It's a global, decentralized system of servers. When you enter a domain name, DNS servers find the corresponding IP address, letting your browser connect to the website. This makes navigating the internet easy, as you don't need to remember numeric IP addresses.

- [ ] [@feed@Explore top posts about DNS](https://app.daily.dev/tags/dns?ref=roadmapsh)￼

### Browsers

Web browsers are apps that let you view websites. When you type a web address, the browser asks a server for the page. It then reads the HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (interactivity) to show you the webpage. Browsers have rendering engines (like Blink in Chrome or Gecko in Firefox) to display content and JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome) to run code. They also handle things like security, bookmarks, and history.

- [ ] [@feed@Explore top posts about Browsers](https://app.daily.dev/tags/browsers?ref=roadmapsh)￼

## HTML

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard for creating web pages, structuring content with elements and attributes. Browsers interpret HTML tags to render pages. HTML5, the current standard, adds semantic elements, multimedia support, and form controls. It works with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, forming web development's foundation.

- [ ] [@article@web.dev: Learn HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html)￼
- [ ] [@video@HTML Full Course - Build a Website Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE)￼

### Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML uses markup to convey the meaning of web content, not just its appearance, by employing elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. This practice enhances accessibility, SEO, and code readability. It includes proper use of headings, lists, and tables. Semantic HTML aids screen readers, improves browser rendering, and offers clearer structure for developers, leading to more meaningful, accessible, and maintainable web documents for both humans and machines.

- [ ] [@feed@Explore top posts about Accessibility](https://app.daily.dev/tags/accessibility?ref=roadmapsh)￼

## CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes websites look good. It's a language used to style HTML documents, controlling things like layout, colors, and fonts. CSS keeps the design separate from the HTML content, which makes websites easier to manage. It uses "selectors" to pick HTML elements and apply styles. CSS also helps make websites responsive, meaning they look good on any device, thanks to media queries. Important ideas in CSS are the cascade (how styles override each other), inheritance (how styles pass from parent to child elements), and specificity (which style rule wins). Modern CSS has cool tools like Flexbox and Grid for layout, plus animations and transitions for interactive designs.

### Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design makes websites look good on all devices, from big desktops to small phones. It uses flexible layouts, images that resize, and CSS media queries to change how the site appears based on screen size. This way, users get a great experience no matter what device they use, and developers don't need to make separate sites for each gadget.

## Authentication Strategies

Authentication strategies verify a user's identity to grant access. Common methods include Basic Auth (username/password), Session-based (server remembers login), Token-based (like JWT, a secure digital key), OAuth (for third-party access like "Login with Google"), and SSO (Single Sign-On, one login for many apps). Knowing these helps choose the right security for your app.

## Web Security Knowledge

Web security involves protecting websites and applications from cyber threats through practices like HTTPS/TLS for secure data, XSS/SQL injection/CSRF prevention, CSP implementation, secure authentication/session management, input validation, clickjacking protection, secure cookie handling, and regular updates. It also means understanding OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities, access controls, secure coding, and staying informed on new threats. A good strategy combines prevention, audits, and incident response to protect web resources and data.

### CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature that controls how web pages access resources from different domains. It allows servers to specify who can access their assets (like APIs or fonts). CORS uses HTTP headers; browsers may send a preflight request to check if the actual request is allowed. This prevents unauthorized access while enabling legitimate cross-origin requests, vital for modern apps using multiple domain services.

- [ ] [@article@Understanding CORS](https://rbika.com/blog/understanding-cors)￼

### HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, the main way data is sent between your browser and websites. HTTPS encrypts this data, making it safer. This is very important for sensitive information like bank logins or emails. It keeps your data private and secure online.

### Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature in web browsers that helps stop attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. It lets website creators tell the browser which sources of content (like scripts, styles, and images) are safe to load. This is done using special instructions sent with the webpage. By limiting where content can come from, CSP makes it much harder for bad code to run on a site. It can also report problems, helping developers find and fix security holes. Setting up CSP needs care to make sure everything works right, especially if the site uses content from other places.

### OWASP Security Risks

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) lists the biggest security dangers for web apps. The OWASP Top 10 includes things like injection attacks, bad authentication, data exposure, and using old, unsafe code. These are common ways hackers break into websites. OWASP gives advice on how to fix these problems by coding securely, checking for issues often, and using strong security from start to finish. Knowing these risks helps protect web apps.

## Type Checkers

Type checkers are tools that look at your code to find and stop errors related to data types (like numbers, strings, etc.) before you run the program. They help make sure your code uses types correctly, catching mistakes early. Examples include TypeScript and Flow for JavaScript, and mypy for Python. These tools add static typing (checking types before running) to languages that usually check types while running. This makes code more reliable, easier to understand, and helps with refactoring. While they add a bit of work, type checkers are great for big projects to improve code quality.

- [ ] [@official@TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)￼
- [ ] [@official@Mypy - Static Type Checker for Python](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)￼

### TypeScript

TypeScript, by Microsoft, is a strongly-typed language that extends JavaScript with optional static typing. It compiles to plain JavaScript, running anywhere JavaScript does. TypeScript enhances IDE support with better code completion, refactoring, and error detection. It introduces interfaces, generics, and decorators for robust software architecture, proving valuable for large apps by improving maintainability and readability. Its type system catches errors early, reducing runtime issues. TypeScript is a standard in modern web development.

## Server-side rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) means websites are built on the server before being sent to your browser as complete HTML. This is different from client-side rendering, where the browser builds the page. SSR helps pages load faster at first and is better for search engines. It's good for sites with lots of content. Frameworks like Next.js (for React) and Nuxt.js (for Vue) use SSR. It can make servers busier but improves performance, especially on slow devices.

### react-router

React Router is a key tool for React apps that need different pages or views. It handles the website's URL, letting you create single-page apps that feel like they have multiple pages. It provides components to define routes (paths to different views) and link between them. Features include lazy loading (loading parts only when needed) and route guards (controlling access to pages). It's the standard for navigation in React apps.
