## **How the Projects Build on Each Other**

1.  **Cloud Resume Challenge (CRC):** This is your foundational cloud project. It introduces you to serverless architecture (S3, Lambda, API Gateway) and provides a tangible, single-purpose portfolio item. It’s perfect for getting your foot in the door with cloud and DevOps skills.
2.  **Evolved Roadmap.sh Project:** This is your full-stack development and DevOps maturity project. It starts with a simple frontend and backend, then grows to a complete CI/CD pipeline and automated infrastructure. It demonstrates your ability to build a traditional, server-based application and manage its entire lifecycle. This shows you can handle both serverless and non-serverless projects.
3.  **Unified IT Environment:** This is your capstone on steroids. It’s a macro-level project that takes your DevOps, cloud, and infrastructure skills to an enterprise level. It demonstrates your ability to architect, provision, and manage a complex, multi-cloud environment with monitoring, security, and orchestration. It proves you can move beyond building a single application and manage an entire IT ecosystem.

These three projects together provide a powerful and comprehensive portfolio that showcases your evolution from a frontend developer to a full-stack expert, a DevOps practitioner, and finally, a cloud architect and consultant.
