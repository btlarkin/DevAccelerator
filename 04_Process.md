3. Draw a simple prototype/wireframe  
4. Nail an MVP & get early feedback  
5. Consider scalability & maintainability  
6. Define core components & pick your stack  
7. Create a project skeleton (mouseless template + Git)  
8. Set up database & data models  
9. Build backend routes (API endpoints)

1. Start with the Client's Goal & Define Your Niche: As a consultant, begin by clearly defining the project's purpose, target audience, and the value it brings to the client's business. This also involves defining your specific expertise and ideal client profile, as highlighted in "how to become a freelance consultant".

2. Write User Stories & Define Your Data Models: Collaborate closely with the client to describe user interactions with the application (user stories) and structure the application's data (data models). This ensures a shared understanding of requirements.

3. Draw a Simple Prototype/Wireframe: Visualize the user interface and flow early in the process. This helps in communicating with the client, getting early feedback, and managing expectations effectively.

4. Nail an MVP (Minimum Viable Product): Identify and prioritize essential features for the initial release. This allows for early deployment of a working version, quick feedback from the client, and iterative development, which is key for efficient project delivery and client satisfaction.

5. Understand the Project's Future: Consider scalability, maintainability, and longevity from the outset. As a consultant, you provide solutions, not just code, so thinking long-term adds significant value.

6. Define Core Components & Pick Your Stack: Determine the high-level architecture (e.g., backend, frontend, database) and select appropriate technologies. This decision should align with client needs, future scalability, and your expertise, potentially including the "top-paying freelance tech skills" you've acquired.

7. Create a Project Skeleton: Set up the fundamental structure of the project, including folder organization, configuring development environments, and establishing version control (e.g., Git). Your "Mouseless Web Dev Project Template" is the ideal tool for this step, providing a pre-configured, efficient development environment.

8. Set Up the Database and Create Data Models: Establish the data layer of the application, ensuring functional data storage and retrieval mechanisms.

9. Build Backend Routes (API Endpoints): Develop server-side logic and application programming interfaces that handle data operations. These routes should be thoroughly tested to ensure they work correctly before integrating with the front end.

10. Work on the Front-End Interface: With a functional backend, development shifts to the user-facing interface, focusing on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design. Connect the front end to the already tested backend. The live reloading feature of your "Mouseless Web Dev Project Template" will significantly speed up this process.

11. Project Iteration & Continuous Testing: Progressively add new features to the project, with continuous testing throughout the development cycle. The emphasis is on early and frequent deployment of working versions to gather client feedback and adapt, which mirrors the agile approaches often used in consulting. Your tmux and nvim setup supports rapid iteration.

12. Add Automated Deployments and Testing: Implement automated deployment processes and integrate robust testing procedures to catch bugs in earlier development phases. This enhances efficiency and the quality of your deliverables as a consultant, a crucial aspect for a "web dev agency" delivering consistent results. Your Linux Shell Scripting and DevOps courses directly support implementing this step effectively.
